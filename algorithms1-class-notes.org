* Prerequisites
- math
  - discrete math
  - proofs by induction
  - Mathematics for Computer Science by Eric Lehman and Tom Layden
- programming
* Merge Sort
- example of divide and conquer
  - break problem into smaller problems then combine the smaller solutions 
* Big Oh
** Omega Notation
- T(n)=Omega(f(n)) if and only if there exists constants C,n0 such that T(n) >= C*f(n) for all n >= n0
** Little-oh Notation
- strictly less than vs big oh which is equal to or less than
** Examples
*** Claim: 2^n+10 = O(2^n)
- Proof: need to pick constants such that
  - (*) 2^n+10 <= c*2^n for all n >= n_0
  - Note: 2^n+10 = 2^10 * 2^n = 1024 * 2^n
  - so if we choose c=1024, n_0=1, then (*) holds
