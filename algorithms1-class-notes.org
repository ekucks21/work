* Prerequisites
- math
  - discrete math
  - proofs by induction
  - Mathematics for Computer Science by Eric Lehman and Tom Layden
- programming
* Merge Sort
- example of divide and conquer
  - break problem into smaller problems then combine the smaller solutions 
* Big Oh
** Omega Notation
- T(n)=Omega(f(n)) if and only if there exists constants C,n0 such that T(n) >= C*f(n) for all n >= n0
** Little-oh Notation
- strictly less than vs big oh which is equal to or less than
** Examples
*** Claim: 2^n+10 = O(2^n)
- Proof: need to pick constants such that
  - (*) 2^n+10 <= c*2^n for all n >= n_0
  - Note: 2^n+10 = 2^10 * 2^n = 1024 * 2^n
  - so if we choose c=1024, n_0=1, then (*) holds
* Divide and Conquer Algorithms 
** Steps
- DIVIDE into smaller problems
- CONQUER via recursive calls
- COMBINE solutions of subproblems into one solution
** An example problem
*** Overview
- Input: array A containing the numbers 1,2,3,... in some arbitrary order
- Output: number of inversions. In other words, number of pairs (i, j) of array indices with i < j and A[i] > A[j].
*** Example 1
- (1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6)
- Inversions: (3,2), (5,2), (5,4)
- Motivation: numerical similarity measure between two ranked lists (e.g. for "collaborative filtering" - propose other things to buy based on other
people with similar purchasing history)
- solution:
  - claim: the split inversions involving and element y in the second array C are precisely the numbers left in the first array B when y is copied to the output D
  - proof:
    - let x be an element of the array B
    - if x is copied to output D before y, then x < y => no inversion involving x and y
    - if y is copied to output D before x, then y < x => x and y are a split inversion
