* The Three Ways
** The First Way: Flow
** The Second Way: The Principles of Feedback
   - In complex systems, no way to achieve perfection
   - Next best thing is detecting something gone wrong early to avoid a catastrophe
   - Treat failure as learning opportunity, not chance to play blame game
*** Working Safely Within Complex Systems
    - Complex work is managed so that problems in design and operations are revealed
    - Problems are swarmed and solved, resulting in quick construction of new knowledge
    - new local knowledge is exploited globally throughout the organization
    - leaders create other leaders who continually grow these types of capabilities
*** See problems as they occur
    - feedback loops
